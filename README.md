#  Python libraries used for data science and data analysis : 
NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides efficient array and matrix operations, as well as a wide range of mathematical functions. NumPy is the foundation for many other data science libraries, such as Pandas and Scikit-learn.

Pandas: Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. Pandas is especially well-suited for working with tabular data, such as spreadsheets and CSV files.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of plots, including line plots, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots. Matplotlib is also used to create more complex visualizations, such as heatmaps and 3D plots.

Seaborn: Seaborn is a library for creating statistical graphics based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for making attractive and informative visualizations. Seaborn is especially useful for creating visualizations that are tailored to specific statistical tasks, such as boxplots, violin plots, and heatmaps.
